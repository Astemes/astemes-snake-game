# Snake Game Test Driven Development in LabVIEW Demonstration

This repository contains code developed while recording the video demonstration of TDD in LabVIEW.
The video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cgOtv9jrpvc).
To run the unit tests you will need LUnit Unit Test Framework available [at VIPM](https://www.vipm.io/package/astemes_lib_lunit/).

The purpose of the video is to demonstrate the workflow when using Test Driven Development to drive LabVIEW design. 

Bofore recording the video the exercise was completed once with little upfront design.
The tests created were written down and the video was recorded using these notes as the only script.
Very little editing went into creating the final video and the video is actually longer than the time it took to first solve the problem, due to the narration.

Appologies for the poor technical quality of the video, this will hopefully be improved if I get around to record more videos.
